%UNTITLED7 Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here
% x is the training input data; a cell col vector with each element as a

% b is the initial beta feature sets. It is supposed to be a col vector
% i is an integer with the number of iterations
% step is the step that we take for each iteration
